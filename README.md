## Energy Consumption Forecasting with ML

The project is a machine learning venture that aims to encourage self-renovation in French single houses through accurate energy usage predictions. The final product of the project is a machine learning model that will estimate the energy consumption of European buildings based on their various features and information about yearly energy consumption. Our team analyzed a large dataset, and performed appropriate data preprocessing to prepare the input for the model training. We started with simple preprocessing techniques and applyed more complicated ones during the optimization step depending on the time constraints. Once the final model was created, we showed how it can be leveraged for energy and cost savings purposes by presenting a market analysis and economic/societal impact in a short video business pitch. The project management included tasks such as data understanding, pre-processing, modeling development, and deployment strategy.
